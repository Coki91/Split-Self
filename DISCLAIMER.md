# Split Self | Horror Mod
## Disclaimers

This mod can interact with your PC in multiple ways; this goes further into detail as to the changes made on your device. None of the changes or actions made to your device damage it in any way. Every version of this mod will not do anything not mentioned outside of this list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of the current update, some PC interaction events may not activate, or the mod may not run, due to different Operating Systems (OS). Please create an issue if you experience something abnormal because of this.

You are highly encouraged to play without reading this, as it may ruin the experience; but if you worry that damage may be done, well, it is open source after all.



With all that being said, here are the events that interact with your computer in some way or another:
- When clicking 'Continue' on the warning screen, a 'begin.txt' file will be created on your desktop
- The 'DoYouSeeMe' event will change your background wallpaper to a distorted pre-made screenshot
- The 'Notepad' event will open a PowerShell notepad to talk to you outside of the game
- The 'TheOtherScreenshot' event will do the same as the 'Notepad' event, but also open a newly created image with your preferred image tool
- The 'Command' event will open the system's command prompt, but it doesn't execute anything and is meant to merely scare the player
- For some events, the mod will sometimes read the user's system name out to them
  - For some Youtubers, the mod will instead call them by their public name, or a variant of their name
