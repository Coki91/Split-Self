# Split Self | Horror Mod
## Disclaimers

This mod can interact with your PC in multiple ways; this goes further into detail as to the changes made on your device. None of the changes or actions made to your device will damage it in any way. Every version of this mod will not do anything not mentioned outside of this list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of the current update, some PC interaction events may not activate, or the mod may not run, due to different Operating Systems (OS). Please create an issue if you experience something abnormal because of this.

> [!NOTE]
> Personally Identifiable Information (PII) can and will be shown to you through this mod. If you wish for this information to be hidden, you can toggle it off by the warning screen shown when you first join a world. You can also do `/splitself information` to show the warning screen again, and toggle it off from there. PII is toggled OFF by default.

You are highly encouraged to play without reading this, as it may ruin the experience. But if you worry that damage may be done, well, it is open source after all. :D



With all that being said, here are the events that interact with your computer in some way or another:
- When clicking 'Continue' on the warning screen, a 'begin.txt' file will be created on your desktop
- The 'DoYouSeeMe' event will change your background wallpaper to a distorted pre-made screenshot
- The 'Notepad' event will open a PowerShell notepad to talk to you outside of the game
- The 'TheOtherScreenshot' event will do the same as the 'Notepad' event, but also open a newly created image with your preferred image tool
- The 'Command' event will open the system's command prompt, but it doesn't execute anything and is meant to merely scare the player
- For some events, the mod will sometimes read the user's system name out to them
  - For some Youtubers, the mod will instead call them by their public name, or a variant of their name
- The 'Browser' event reveals personal browser history across Firefox, Google, and Opera GX
- The 'Emergency' event will reveal your city via GeoIP. VPNs will counteract this.
- The 'Freedom' event will temporarily cover your entire screen and say "Let Me Free."
- The 'Shrink' event will take you out of fullscreen, shrink your game slowly and start shaking.
